# Machine-readable version of Figure 6 workflow for ATAC-seq DA analysis with csaw
# will describe methods for using 1) pre-defined peaks from MACS2 as well as 2) csaw de novo enriched window calling by local enrichment, 
# and normalization methods including 1) TMM on binned counts and 2) loess-based for trended biases

# brief aside: use gc() to help clear memory after intensive commands if crashes/errors occur

# example experimental design: n=2 mouse ATAC-seq biological replicates for two conditions: treat and control
